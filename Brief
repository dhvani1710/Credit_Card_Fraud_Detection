Employed Pandas and Seaborn libraries in Python for data visualization, Univariate and Bivariate analysis, and pre-processing of a highly imbalanced dataset containing credit card transactions data
Implemented multiple statistical and Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, kNearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest achieving classification recall up to 93%
Benchmarked the performance of the models on the basis of theirF1 scores and Confusion Matrix,
and plotted the ROC curves, observed that Logistic Regression delivers the best results of all models
